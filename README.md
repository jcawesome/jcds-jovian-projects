# Jovian Data Science Projects
This repository will be used to store all my personal data science projects that will be later written on my Medium blog

## Zero-To-Gans
Compilation of notebooks from the **Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs** course.
* [Insurance cost prediction using linear regression](https://github.com/jcawesome/jcds-jovian-projects/blob/main/notebooks/insurance-linear-regression)
* [Classifying images of everyday objects using a neural network](https://github.com/jcawesome/jcds-jovian-projects/tree/main/notebooks/cifar10-feedforward)
* [Intel Image Classification](https://github.com/jcawesome/jcds-jovian-projects/tree/main/notebooks/landscape-classification-zerotogans-project#landscape-image-classification-using-convolutional-neural-networks) 

## Zero-To-GBMs
Compilation of notebooks from the **Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GBMs** course.
