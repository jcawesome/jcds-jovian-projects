* Downloading a real-world dataset from Kaggle
* Splitting a dataset into training, validation & test sets
* Imputing and scaling numeric features
* Encoding categorical columns as one-hot vectors
* Training a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn
* Evaluating a model using a validation set and test set
